% Purpose:to calculate a flight path of a projectile and graph it
g = 9.81; % gravitational constant, in m/s^2
dt = 0.5; % time step in s
v0 = 300; % intitial velocity, in m/s
theta = 60; % launch angle, in degrees
U = v0*cosd(theta); % the initial velocity multiplied by the cosine of 60 
degrees
V = v0*sind(theta); % the initial velocity multiplied by the sine of 60 
degrees
t = 0; % time=0
i = 1; % index starts at 1
% first elements in arrays
y(1) = 0; 
x(1) = 0;
u(1) = U;
v(1) = V;
T(1) = t;
figure(1) % plot 1
plot3(x(i),t,y(i)) % plots first point
title('Projectile Motion (No Air Resistance)') % title of the graph
xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)') % x axis label of the graph
ylabel('Time (s)') % y axis label of the graph
zlabel('Vertical Distance (m)') % z axis label of the graph
grid on
hold on
while y(i) >= 0 % Calculate the flight path while the projectile is airborne
 t = t + dt; % giving time a way to progress
 i=i+1; % giving the equations a way to progress
 x(i) = U*t; % horizontal distance (x) of the projectile, in m
 y(i) = -1/2*g*t^2+V*t; % altitude (y) of the projectile, in m
 u(i) = U; % equation of the velocity in the horizontal direction, in m/s
 v(i) = -g*t+V; % equation of velocity in the vertical direction, in m/s
 T(i) = t; % time array in seconds
plot3(x(i),T(i),y(i),'r.') % plots one point at a time as a red dot
pause(0.05) % pause for 0.05 seconds after each point
end % ends while loop
[maxy,index] = max(y); % determine the max height
stem3(x(index),T(index),maxy,'ok') % creates a stem 3 plot, a 3-D plot of a 
regular stem graph
str = sprintf('max height = %g m',max(y)'); % a string that prints the maximum 
height of the projectile after the data is plotted 
text(x(index),T(index),str) % displays the label and the max height value
hold off
